Project Title
Curriculum - Hash Tables

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, focusing on understanding and implementing hash tables in C programming language. Hash tables are fundamental data structures used for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Overview

This project covers various aspects of hash tables, including implementation, functions for adding elements, retrieving elements, printing the hash table, and deleting the hash table. It also includes learning objectives, resources for further understanding, and requirements for implementation.
Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

    Understand what a hash function is and what makes a good hash function.
    Explain the concept of a hash table, its operation, and usage.
    Understand collision handling techniques in hash tables.
    Analyze the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables.
    Identify common use cases of hash tables.

Resources

To successfully complete this project, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

    What is a HashTable Data Structure - Introduction to Hash Tables, Part 0
    Hash function
    Hash table
    All about hash tables
    Why hash tables and not arrays

Requirements

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    Code compilation: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All files should end with a newline
    Use Betty style for code formatting (betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl)
    Avoid using global variables
    Limit of 5 functions per file
    Use of C standard library is allowed
    Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file (hash_tables.h)
    Header files should be include guarded

Tasks

    hash_table_create: Function to create a hash table.
    djb2: Implementation of the djb2 hash function.
    key_index: Function to get the index of a key in the hash table.
    hash_table_set: Function to add an element to the hash table.
    hash_table_get: Function to retrieve a value associated with a key.
    hash_table_print: Function to print the hash table.
    hash_table_delete: Function to delete the hash table.
    sorted_hash_table: Advanced task to implement a sorted hash table.

Testing

It is recommended to work together on a set of tests to ensure the correctness and functionality of the implemented functions.
Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive understanding of hash tables and their implementation in C. Completing this project will enhance your proficiency in data structures and algorithms, which are essential skills for any software engineer.
