# 0x15. C - File I/O

## Project Description

This project focuses on file input and output operations in the C programming language. It covers essential topics related to handling files, working with file descriptors, and understanding file permissions. The project consists of several tasks that will help you become proficient in file I/O operations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Locate the right sources of information online.
- Create, open, close, read, and write files in C.
- Understand the concept of file descriptors.
- Recognize the three standard file descriptors and their purposes, along with their POSIX names.
- Utilize I/O system calls such as open, close, read, and write.
- Work with file flags like O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, and O_RDWR.
- Set file permissions when creating a file with the open system call.
- Distinguish between system calls and regular functions.

## Requirements

General requirements for this project include:

- Using allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Compiling all code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- Ensuring that all code files end with a new line.
- Providing a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- Adhering to the Betty coding style, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Restricting the use of global variables.
- Having no more than 5 functions per file.
- Allowing only specific C standard library functions: malloc, free, and exit. Functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc., are forbidden.
- Allowing specific syscalls: read, write, open, close.
- Using the provided _putchar.c file, but not pushing it to your repo.
- Including the prototypes of all functions and the _putchar function in a header file named main.h.
- Employing include guards for all header files.
- Using symbolic constants (POSIX) instead of hardcoding numbers where applicable.

## Tasks

### 0. Tread lightly, she is near

Write a function that reads a text file and prints its content to the POSIX standard output.

### 1. Under the snow

Create a function that creates a file with specified permissions and writes text content to it.

### 2. Speak gently, she can hear

Write a function that appends text at the end of an existing file.

### 3. cp

Create a program that copies the content of one file to another, while preserving file permissions.

## Usage

To compile the programs for each task, use the provided Makefile. For example, to compile Task 0:

```shell
make 0-read_textfile
This will generate an executable file named 0-read_textfile.

To run the compiled programs, use the following syntax:

shell
Copy code
./<executable> <input_file> <output_file>
Replace <executable> with the appropriate program name and provide the necessary input and output file arguments.
