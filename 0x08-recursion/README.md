Task 0: She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget

Function Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
Description: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.
Task 1: Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together

Function Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);
Description: Write a function that prints a string in reverse, using recursion.
Task 2: Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange

Function Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);
Description: Write a function that returns the length of a string, using recursion.
Task 3: You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling

Function Prototype: int factorial(int n);
Description: Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number, using recursion. If n is less than 0, it should return -1.
Task 4: Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate

Function Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
Description: Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y, using recursion. If y is less than 0, it should return -1.
Task 5: Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer

Function Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
Description: Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number, using recursion. If there's no natural square root, it should return -1.
Task 6: Inception. Is it possible?

Function Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);
Description: Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number and 0 otherwise, using recursion.
