Curriculum: SE Foundations - 0x1C. C - Makefiles
Welcome to the SE Foundations curriculum project on Makefiles. In this project, you will learn and practice using Makefiles in the context of C programming. Below, you'll find details about the tasks involved, learning objectives, requirements, and resources to help you successfully complete this project.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:

Understand what make and Makefiles are
Know when, why, and how to use Makefiles
Define rules and understand how to set and use them
Differentiate between explicit and implicit rules
Identify common and useful rules
Understand variables in Makefiles and how to set and use them
Resources
To successfully complete this project, make sure to read or watch the following resources:

What is a makefile and how does it work
Installing the make utility
make official documentation
More about Makefile
Project Tasks
This project consists of several tasks that will help you practice and solidify your understanding of Makefiles in C programming. Here's a brief overview of the tasks involved:

0-Makefile: Create your first Makefile.
1-Makefile: Enhance your Makefile with variables CC and SRC.
2-Makefile: Develop a useful Makefile with additional variables and rules.
3-Makefile: Extend your Makefile to include rules for cleaning and recompiling.
4-Makefile: Create a complete Makefile with compiler flags and advanced rules.
5-Island_Perimeter.py: Implement a function in Python without using any imported modules.
Requirements
Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
GCC Version: 9.3.0
GNU Make Version: 4.2.1
All files should end with a new line
Ensure to include a README.md file at the root of the project folder
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository alx-low_level_programming to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory 0x1C-makefiles within the cloned repository.
Read the task descriptions and begin working on each task according to the specified requirements.
Use the provided resources and your programming knowledge to complete each task successfully.
Ensure your code meets the standards mentioned in the project description.
Conclusion
Congratulations on completing the SE Foundations project on Makefiles! We hope you've gained valuable insights into using Makefiles for C programming. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to your mentors or peers for support.
